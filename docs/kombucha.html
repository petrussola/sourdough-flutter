    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Kombucha Making Toolkit</strong></p>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 22, 2026</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Kombucha Making Toolkit ("the App") is a free, ad-supported mobile application that provides kombucha brewing recipes, ingredient guides, and proportion calculators. This privacy policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. There are no user accounts, no login, and no forms that request personal data. All recipe and calculator data is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. AdMob may automatically collect certain information from your device to serve and personalize ads. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> - derived from your IP address, used for ad targeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> - such as the Android Advertising ID, used to serve and measure ads.</li>
        <li><strong>App interaction data</strong> - such as app usage and interaction with ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> - crash logs and performance data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected and shared by Google AdMob for the purpose of advertising and analytics. For more information on how Google handles this data, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The App does not share any data directly. However, Google AdMob may share the data it collects with third-party advertising partners to serve relevant ads. Please refer to Google's privacy documentation linked above for details.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data transmitted by the AdMob SDK is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On Android: go to <strong>Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
