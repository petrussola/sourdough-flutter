    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Biblia Takatifu Swahili Bible ("the App") is a free Bible reading application. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App itself does not directly collect personal information. However, we use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

    <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> - Based on IP address, used for serving relevant ads</li>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> - Advertising ID, used for ad personalization and measurement</li>
        <li><strong>App interaction data</strong> - Information about how you interact with ads (views, clicks)</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> - Crash logs and performance data to improve ad delivery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected and processed by Google in accordance with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We share data with Google AdMob for the purpose of displaying advertisements. We do not sell your personal information to any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores your reading preferences (such as font size and theme settings) locally on your device using shared preferences. This data is not transmitted to any server.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data transmitted between the App and third-party services (Google AdMob) is encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings (Settings > Google > Ads on Android)</li>
        <li>You can reset your advertising identifier at any time through your device settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>The advertising data collected by Google AdMob is retained according to Google's data retention policies. Local preferences stored on your device are retained until you uninstall the App or clear the App's data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
